# 📊 SQL Project : HR Employee Retention Analysis using SQLite & Python

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition using real-world HR data. Using a blend of SQL and Python, we identified patterns in employee turnover by department, job role, salary, and tenure.

It simulates a business use case where a company’s HR team wants to reduce attrition and understand key drivers behind employee churn.
